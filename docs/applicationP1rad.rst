Application of P1 radiation models and methods to solve
========================================================
- P1 method is widely used radiation models in the high fidely combustion application using Conjugate gradient method as suggested by :cite:p:`krishnamoorthy2017computationally`.

- P1 method is also widely used in the prediction of arc temperature from the nozzle arcs as suggested by :cite:p:`dixon2004comparison`.

- There have been many proposal on solving radiation using implicit formulations one which includes multi-grid approach as suggested by :cite:p:`joubert2003lamg`.

- Many researchers have developed various efficient algorithms for multi-grid as sugested in works of :cite:p:`carrington2005preconditioning`.
